# The State of Go 2016

Looking at some of the stuff comming out of Go right now I am getting really 
interested in it again as a primary utility language.

<!-- more -->

The slide deck I am referencing is at <https://talks.golang.org/2016/state-of-go.slide#1>
Crusing through this deck it looks like the Go people are committed to making Go great and with 
all the changes that have went in the past year they are succeeding. Take a peek at the deck and be prepared 
to be amazed.
