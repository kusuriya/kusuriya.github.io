# Finally and thank you freenode  
So while I was reading various things today I tripped over [http://blog.freenode.net/2014/10/user-enabled-sendpass/](this). So now if for some reason you forgot your nickserv password you just pop `/msg NickServ SENDPASS <account>` and if you have an email address attached to your nickserv account you now can reset your own password and not have to wait for an admin to pop on, reconize you, then send you the reset mail.
