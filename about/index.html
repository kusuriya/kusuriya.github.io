    Spends the majority of the day frolicing on comptuer terminals and can be occasionaly found wandering amoung woodlands.</p>
    <p>Seriously though I never know really what to put on these sort of pages. I am generally a lover of all things electrionic or computers, the occasional food item, and am really interested
    in automating systems and most aspects of that.<br/> I know many computer languages but due to my most recent projects my proficency is mostly C# and PowerShell.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions feel free to find me at any of the links in the footer and reach out, I generally try to be pleasant to interact with.</p>
