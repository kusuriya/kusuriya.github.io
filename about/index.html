    <p><span style="color: #005500;font-size: 2em;">Jason Barbier:</span><br/>
        I am an all around computer enthusiast and tinkerer of systems. I have a fairly decent sized home lab and will occassionaly post about stuff related to what I am currently working on.<br/>
        My interests are fairly varied so expect to see things about any OS family, debugging and taking apart systems, home labbing, home automation, etc. <br/>
        My views are my own and do not reflect that of any sane person let alone my employer.<br/>
        I have an expanded contact card at <a href="https://kusuriya.omg.lol">kusuriya.omg.lol</a></br>
